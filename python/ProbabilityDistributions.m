% A single Bernoulli trial: 
%  outcome = 1 with probabilty p
%  outcome = 0 with probabilty 1-p
% 
%  This is a DISCRETE distribution because by definition it only takes on
%  specific, discrete values (in this case either 0 or 1)

% We can use rand, which produces a random variable on the interval (0,1)
%  -- which means that all values are greater than 0 and less than 1
p = 0.7; % choose value for p
outcome = rand() <= p; % create logical variable from single pick

% Or, equivalently, use binornd -- a random pick from a binomial
%  distribution with n=1 (i.e., a Bernoulli distribution is a special
%  case of a binomial distribution with n=1)
p = 0.7; % choose value for p
n = 1;   % special case of just one trial
outcome = binornd(n,p);

% Check that we are generating the probability correctly by generating a
% lot of trials and testing if the outcome is as expected.

%% Poisson distribution
%
%  Canvas Discussion: https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1358934/discussion_topics/5130868
%  Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution
%  Mathworld: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PoissonDistribution.html
%
% The Poisson distribution is closely related to the binomial distribution.
% In both cases, they measure the number of "successes" (or binary events)
%  within a given interval. For the binomial distribution, these events
%  occur within discrete "attempts" (that is, within individaul Bernoulli
%  trials) that we assume occur at regularly spaced times throughout the
%  full interval. For the Poisson distribution, these events can occur at any
%  time in the interval. Thus, the Poisson distribution describes the case
%  in which the time between Bernoulli "attempts" or trials -> zero (the 
%  "->" reads as "approaches"). This is equivalent to saying that the number
%  of attempts approaces infinity. 
%
% This is a CONTINUOUS distribution because it describes the probability of
%  any possible time of an event occurring within the given interval.

% Let's examine the relationship between the Poisson pdf and binomial pdf 
%  by introducing the concept of a Poisson point process (PPP). A PPP is 
%  a process that generates binary events at a constant RATE lambda. The
%  key here is that time is contininuous, so probability cannot be
%  determined with respect to a fixed time but rather a fixed time
%  interval (because any fixed time is infinitesimally small). 
%  Thus, we think of events occuring at some rate (mean number of
%  events per unit time) as opposed to a probability (probability of
%  occurrance of the event at a given time).
%  The number of events that the PPP generates in a given interval is a random 
%  variable that is distributed as a Poisson pdf (i.e., a PPP is a way of 
%  generating a Poisson PDF).
%
% See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_point_process

cla reset; hold on;

% Get the histogram
[N,X] = hist(intervalsBetweenEvents, 50);

% Here the interval (the x-axis that is binned in the histogram to visualize
%  it, but the actual values can take on any continuous value because they
%  represent the amount of time since the previous event) is a continuous
%  variable, so to normalize the histogram to make a pdf we
%  can't just sum the values -- we have to sum the values multiplied by the
%  bin width (i.e., take the integral). We use matlab's "trapz" which
%  treats each bin as a trapezoid (because the heights before and after can
%  be slightly different) to compute the integral:
normalizedIntervals = N./trapz(X, N);
bar(X,normalizedIntervals);

%
% Here's a better way to simulate a Poisson process: instead of
% approximating continuous time with small time bins, directly simulate the
% (continuous) time between events as an exponential
lambda = 2; % events/sec
M = 5000; % events/run
N = 1000; % number of runs

% The mean of the (exponential) distribution of intervals between events
%  generated by a Poisson process is equal to the inverse of the rate at 
%  which the events are generated (because time/event is the inverse of
%  events/time)
mu = 1/lambda; 

% Simulate a bunch of intervals picked from an exponential distribution
intervals = exprnd(mu, M, N);

% Sum them per run (columns) so the events correspond to timestamps
times = cumsum(intervals);

% A bit of a cheat -- find the run with the shortest time, then use that as
% the interval to test across runs
minTime = min(times(end,:));

% Count the times less than the min interval per run
counts = sum(times<=minTime)';

% Check mean, var (for a simulated Posson process, the mean and var should
% be pretty close to each other -- where "pretty close" is going to depend
% on factors like N and M)
disp(sprintf('lambda*deltaT = %.2f, mean = %.2f, var = %.2f', ...
   lambda*minTime, mean(counts), var(counts)))

% Now let's consider the "Randomness" of this process in more detail.
% We say that it has a "flat hazard function": at any given point in time, 
%  there is an equal probabilty of the event occuring, given that it 
%  hasn't occurred yet. We can compute this function from the simulated 
%  intervals as the pdf/(1-cdf) [that is, the probability of a given 
%  interval, defined as the pdf, divided by 1 - the probablity that the
%  given interval occurred]:

% Compute over this range. See below for an explanation of what the upper
% range (here scaled by rangeScale) does to the calcluation.
rangeScale = 10;
xs = 0:0.01:mu*rangeScale;

% Compute separately per run, will store in this matrix
hazards = zeros(length(xs), N);

% Loop through the runs
for ii = 1:N
   
   % Get the histogram of intervals using bins defined by "xs"
   counts = hist(intervals(intervals(:,ii)<minTime, ii), xs);
   
   % Convert into a pdf
   pdf = counts./trapz(xs, counts);

   % Compute the cdf
   cdf = cumtrapz(xs, pdf);
   
   % Save the hazard
   hazards(:,ii) = pdf./(1-cdf);
end

% Show the mean hazard across runs. Notice that: 
%  1. it is roughly constant and equal to 2 --- which is the rate (lambda) 
%     that we started with above (and the inverse of the mean of the 
%     exponential distribution of intervals that we generated).
%  2. The mean is noisy, especially for long intervals (large values
%     along the x-axis) - this is because those intervals don't happen very
%     much (the long tail of the exponential distribution) so even with
%     large N those points are undesampled.
%  3. For very large intervals, the results are not just noisy, but biased
%     (the hazard rate starts to sweep upwards on the right of the figure).
%     This is because the true exponential has a tail that goes to
%     infinity, but here we stop it at some finite time. This procedure
%     implies that events that in a real Poisson process (with a real flat
%     hazard) would occur after a very long interval will be counted here as
%     bunching up in the longest bins we check -- so the probability of
%     occurrance in those bins will be slighly higher than expected for a
%     real exponential, making the hazard rate larger, too. You can make
%     this effect more pronounced by choosing a shorter range of xs, above.
