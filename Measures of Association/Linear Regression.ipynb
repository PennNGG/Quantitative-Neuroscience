Infer if a measured variable $Y$ is associated with another variable (predictor) of set of variables (predictors) $X$. This is a hypothesis test. For example, to test if there is a positive relationship between two variables: as you are given more ice cream to eat ($X$ variable), does your body weight ($Y$ variable) change (increase or decrease)? A *p*-value can be assigned to this association; more below on this.\n","\n","2\\. What is the strength of the association? How tightly are these two variables associated? A positive beta weight implies a positive relationship (both go up/down at the same time), whereas a negative value implies a negative relationship (they go in opposite directions).\n","\n","It is critical to remember that unlike a correlation coefficient, whose magnitude always varies between -1 and 1 independently of the magnitude of the quantities being correlated, in linear regression the magnitude of any given beta weight depends critically on the units and magnitudes of the quantities used in the regression. Therefore, comparing beta weights from two different regressions (or even from different terms in the same multiple linear regression equation, if the predictors are not independent!) is not always straightforward, as discussed [here](http://www.glmj.org/archives/articles/Ziglari_v43n2.pdf).\n","\n","One way around this problem is to use standardized linear regression, in which the same linear model is used but applied to standardized variables. That is, each of the independent and dependent variables are converted in units of z-score: subtract the sample mean and divide by the sample standard deviation.\n","\n","3\\. The equation that describes the relationship can be used to predict unknown values. That is, once the values of the betas in the above equations are known, they can be used with new values of the independent variables to predict the value of the dependent variable under those conditions.\n","\n","There are some assumptions in order to use linear regression. For example, for any value of $X$ there exists a normal distribution of $Y$ values, and the relationship between $X$ and $Y$ is linear. Make sure that you always look at your data first (e.g., in scatterplots) to get a first-pass impression if these assumptions are reasonable."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"IyCyVIIDH0rb"},"source":["# Calculating the slope of the regression line and its intercept"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sYDtxlCZH5BC"},"source":["The **slope** $b=\\frac{\\sum{X_iY_i-\\frac{\\sum{X_i}\\sum{Y_i}}{n}}}{\\sum{X^2_i-\\frac{(\\sum{X_i})^2}{n}}}$, where *i* is the individual values of $X$ an $Y$ and *n* is the number of observations.
