    "**Answer**: Statistical significance from the Frequentist perspective is typically measured by comparing $p$ to a threshold value; e.g., $p<0.05$. In this case, $p$ is shorthand for \"the probabilty of obtaining the data under the Null Hypothesis\", so we are checking for: $$p(data\\,|\\,Null\\,Hypothesis) < 0.05$$\n",
    "Here we take the Null Hypothesis as \"not infected\", and the data are just the single positive test. Therefore, the relvant p-value is simply the false-positive rate: $p=0.05$, which is typically considered \"not significant.\" However, you can also see that it is not particularly informative."
