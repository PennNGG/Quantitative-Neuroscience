function [b, bint, h, p, LLFULL, LLRED] = regressW(y,s,A,alpha,col2zero)% regressW peforms weighted least squares. % It is very similar to matlab's regress.m. Only here, each observation,% y, is associated with uncertainty, s.  %% b = regressW(y,s,A)%   returns the coefficients of y = A*b which are best in the weighted%   least squares sense. Note that larger s means that this observation%   will have *less* leverage on the fit. If s is a column of 1's, the%   routine should be equivalent to standard least squares and return the%   same arguments as regress.m (although they are calculated differently).% [b,bint] = regressW(y,s,A,alpha)%   adds joint confidence intervals to the return argument. The default value%   for alpha is 0.05% [b,bint,h]  = regressW(y,s,A,alpha,col2zero)%   h is the result of an hypothesis test that b_i is 0 evaluated at the%   value in alpha. The vector col2zero lists the columns of A that are%   to be tested (i.e., the values of i in b_i). The default is to test%   each column one by one. % [b,bint,h,p]  = regressW(y,s,A,alpha,col2zero)%   returns the p values% [b,bint,h,p,LLFULL,LLRED] = regressW(y,s,A,alpha,col2zero)%   returns the log likelihood of obtaining the data in y given the full%   model each of the values associated with reduced models in which the%   columns in col2zero are set to 0.%% Note, the p values are computed on the assumption that error is% distributed as multivariate normal with expectation given by regression% and covariance estimated by the data. A likelihood ratios are then% computed by refitting the model without the coefficient.%% see lscov.m and regress.m%% Note, this function is intended to supercede nestedFml.m% limitations: it is not possible to test the model with more than one% column set to 0 right now. But it's easy to use 2 calls and comparing% log likelihood ratios returned in LLFULL. If you need to do this,%		p = 1-chi2cdf(2*(llikfull-llikred),df);% can be used to test p(H0), where llikfull is LLFULL from the truly full% model and llikred is LLFULL returned from the call with the reduced% model. The difference in columns of A under these calls is df.%% Ref. Draper & Smith, 2nd ed. pp. 97-98.
