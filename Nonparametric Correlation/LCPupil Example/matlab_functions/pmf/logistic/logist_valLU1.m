function ps_ = logist_valLU1(fits, data)% function ps_ = logist_valLU1(fits, data)%% Uses the logistic model to compute p (probability of% making a particular decision) for the given data (m rows% of trials x n columns of data categories) and parameters% (nx1). Assumes logit(p) (that is, ln(p/(1-p)) is a linear% function of the data.% fits(end) is upper AND lower asymptote (lapse rate) described% by Abbott's law (see Strasburger 2001, or Finney 1974)% mxn times nx1 gives mx1ps_ = fits(end) + (1 - 2*fits(end))./(1+exp(-(data*fits(1:end-1))));
